                <h1>Hello, and welcome to the Extreme Sports Society.</h1>
                <p>Here we organise a wide range of activities focussed around extreme sports. We are interested in everything from Wingsuit flying and Mountaineering to Scuba Diving and Tree Trekking.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our goal is to bring like-minded people together who enjoy pushing the boundaries of what is considered fun or just pure madness. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Of course you don’t need to be a lunatic to be involved. Many members join our society just to have an opportunity to spectate extreme sports without having to take part. </p>

                <h2>Why Join?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Upon joining the society you become part of a family. An extremely big, extremely estranged family, but a family none the less with plenty of “mental” Uncles and “cool” Aunts. You will be invited to all events and we try to organise get togethers in areas all over the world so that everyone has a fair chance to attend. You receive a discount from selected retailers and receive free entry to all events. Membership only costs £5 a month or an annual fee of £40, saving you £20 p/a.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Membership can be cancelled at anytime, but why would you want to?</p>
